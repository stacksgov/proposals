# Proposals

This repository contains several miscellaneous governance proposals, [tracked as issues](https://github.com/stacksgov/proposals/issues), and we are still determining the role of this repository relative to the [existing SIP process](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md).
